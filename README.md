# Coleta Run
This game was developed as part of the Computer Graphics course in the Computer Engineering program at UNIVASF, and is based on the concept of selective waste collection.

## Summary

It’s a 2D competitive game where two players compete to collect and correctly dispose of the most garbage bags within a set time limit. Throughout the match, garbage bags of different categories will randomly appear across the map. Each player must race to collect the bags and deliver them to the correct trash bin to earn points. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score wins.
